# The Odin Project Web Developement 
## Project: Etch-a-Sketch

Etch A Sketch is a project from The Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

**Live preview** of my project [here](https://nathimamba.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

### Outcome of this project: ###
* Deepened knowledge of **DOM** and its **manipulation**.
* Improved **CSS Grid** understanding and usage.
* Greatly improved **functionality** in general (shortened, optimized and reusable functions).
* Instead of prompt, I added three grid size options for **better UX** and **UI**.
